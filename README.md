# Tool_Installation_Scripts
Bash,python and golang scripts to auto install tools which have complex installation.
Welcome to the Tool_Installation_Scripts repository! Here, you will find a collection of public scripts that can be used to automatically install various tools that have complex installation procedures. These scripts are written in a variety of languages including Bash, Python, and Golang.

The purpose of this repository is to make it easier for users to install and use these tools. By providing these scripts, the installation process is streamlined and less time-consuming. Additionally, the scripts can be used as a reference for those who are manually installing the tools.

To use the scripts in this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the appropriate directory for the tool you wish to install. Then, run the script with the necessary permissions (usually as root or using sudo).

Please note that some scripts may require additional dependencies or configuration before they can be run. Be sure to read the comments in the script and any accompanying documentation before running it.

Additionally, please keep in mind that some of the scripts may not work properly on certain systems, or may be out of date. Be sure to test the scripts on your system before using them in a production environment.

We hope that you find these scripts useful and that they make your tool installation process a bit easier. If you have any suggestions for improvements or new tools that should be added, please feel free to open an issue or pull request on the repository.
